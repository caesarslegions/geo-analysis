  # The "OMIT_VALUES" was not working.
  # This new line tells Netlify's scanner to turn off the "smart detection"
  # that is causing the false positive on the Firebase library.
  # This is safe because your actual keys are stored in Netlify's environment.

# This part tells Netlify to treat your "api" folder as serverless functions.
# It's the standard setting and good practice to have.
